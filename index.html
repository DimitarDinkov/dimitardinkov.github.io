                    <h2>I have experience with&nbsp;<strong>C/C++/C#</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unity Engine</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unreal Engine</strong>, and several additional tools and languages.&nbsp;<br></h2>
                    <h3><br>I recently graduated from&nbsp;<strong>DigiPen Institute of Technology</strong>&nbsp;where I attained a&nbsp;<strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Game Design</strong>. It was a difficult and humbling voyage but I know that I have grown as a developer to the point where I can be an efficient, hardworking and communicative team member.<br><br>I have a huge passion for programming and I'm always willing to take on a challenging project. As well as having academic experience, I'm a quick learner and I'm comfortable adapting to difficult situations.
