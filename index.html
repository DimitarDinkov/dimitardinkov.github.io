                                <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Abyssal" was a lesson in making C++ engines and the difficulties that can arise without years of commercial development. For this project I was in charge of implementing FMOD into our engine and created an easy-to-use system of AudioEmitters and an AudioListener. I also took the reigns on the player controller, camera controller, and filling out the soundscape to create an immersive underwater experience. The development of this game was strained towards the end, but ultimately we ended up with a fun and engaging product that I'm very proud to have contributed to.<br><br>An overview of my completed tasks for this project include:<br><br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; FMOD Engine Integration (C++ Low Level)<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Audio Listener &amp; Audio Emitter<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; SFX &amp; Soundscape<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Music Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Player Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Camera Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Tutorialization<br></p>

                                <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Steam Skies" was my first serious game project at DigiPen and involved creating a simple game engine out of the rudimentary skeleton of a 2D engine. For this project I mainly focused on FMOD integration and soundscape realization but I also took the lead on the player controller and interactable clouds that the player can fly through. The final product was very fun to play, as playtesting showed, and ended up being a really solid project that I'm proud of. As a team, we collaborated efficiently and created a good game out of our work.&nbsp;<br><br>An overview of my completed tasks for this project include:<br><br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; FMOD Engine Integration (C Low Level)<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Memory Leak Testing &amp; Repair<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Player Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Camera Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; SFX &amp; Soundscape<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Music &amp; Music Controller<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Clouds &amp; Cloud Manager<br></p>
